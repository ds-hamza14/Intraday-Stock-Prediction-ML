# Intraday Stock Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that explore machine learning models to predict intraday stock price movements. The project focuses on analyzing historical stock data to generate actionable short-term predictions, which can be useful for traders and financial analysts.

## 📁 Contents

- `IntraDayStockPrediction.ipynb`: Main notebook implementing intraday stock prediction using machine learning techniques.
- `StockPredTest.ipynb`: A secondary/test notebook to experiment with different model configurations or validation strategies.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to use historical intraday trading data to predict future stock movements. The project involves:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building and training regression or classification models
- Evaluating performance using appropriate financial metrics

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.)

## 📈 Sample Results

Plots and performance metrics are included in the notebooks to evaluate prediction accuracy and model efficiency.
